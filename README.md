## Overview

**NextSet** is your personal iOS workout tracker designed to help you level up your fitness game. Track your workouts day-by-day, log exercises, sets, and reps — and most importantly, **see your progress and push yourself further every time**. 

By focusing on **progressive overload**, NextSet empowers you to beat your previous best and achieve new personal records with every session.

## How It Works

2. **Log Sets & Reps:** Input the number of sets and reps for each exercise.
3. **Review Past Workouts:** See your previous performances to challenge yourself.
4. **Push for Progress:** Use your history to increase weight, reps, or sets — keeping progressive overload front and center.
